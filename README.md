### Scripts

#### __create-pr__

This script streamlines the process of creating a Pull Request. When your branch is ready to be pulled into the `main` or 
another `[target]` branch, this tool will generate it for you, request review form [@charcoalphp/reviewers][reviewers] and add
a beautiful and readable release note generated from the differences between the 2 breanches. 

```shell
# target: the target branch for the pull request. Defaults to [main]
$ ./create-pr [target]
```

#### __create-release-notes__ (_optional tool_)

This script generates release notes on request, returning a changelog based on the requested `range of commits` or `branches`

Documentation:

```shell
$ ./build/script/create-release-notes --help
```

Example:

```shell
$ ./build/script/create-release-notes -g --from main
```
