Charcoal is a web framework and content management system that adapts to all of
your project's needs.

This repository is a monorepo containing the entirety of the web framework.
Charcoal can be used as a full stack framework or as standalone packages which
can be used independently.

## Charcoal packages

Core packages can be found in the [`packages`](packages/) directory.

## Installation

The preferred (and only supported) method is with Composer:

```shell
composer require charcoal/charcoal
```

To start from a working skeleton:

```shell
composer create-project charcoal/boilerplate
```

### Standalone packages

The Charcoal framework is split into standalone packages which can be used
independently. For example, a project might not need an administration panel,
a queue system, or to send emails.

```shell
composer require charcoal/app charcoal/api custom/admin 
```

### Migrate a project to `charcoal/charcoal`

The following will aide with converting a project from
`locomotivemtl/charcoal-*` to `charcoal/*`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Previously all core packages maintained their own version numbering independently.
>
> The monorepo framework uses a shared version number for all core packages
> for consistent and expected interoperability.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The contrib packages continue to maintain their existing independent version numbering.

<details>
    <summary>Option A ‚Äî If you want to replace all packages with the full-stack framework package:</summary>

1. Remove requirements for core packages (`locomotivemtl/charcoal-*`)
   in your `composer.json` file.
2. Replace requirements for contrib packages  (`locomotivemtl/charcoal-contrib-*`),
   in your `composer.json` file, with equivalents from [`charcoal/contrib-*`][charcoal-org].
3. Run `composer require charcoal/charcoal` to install the framework.
4. Run `composer update` to ensure all requirements are up-to-date.
5. Run the following migration script:

   ```shell
   ./vendor/charcoal/charcoal/build/script/migrate-project
   ```
   
   The `migrate-project` script will update all metadata paths in your project's
   configuration files. Afterwards, it will edit or create a `.env` environment
   variable file with the key `PACKAGES_PATH` set to:
   `vendor/charcoal/charcoal/packages`.

   This allows the `%packages.path%` string template to expand to the packages
   location within `charcoal/charcoal`, otherwise it will lead in the `vendor`
   directory.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Option B ‚Äî If you want to replace all packages with new standalone packages:</summary>

1. Replace requirements for core packages (`locomotivemtl/charcoal-*`),
   in your `composer.json` file.
2. Replace requirements for contrib packages  (`locomotivemtl/charcoal-contrib-*`),
   in your `composer.json` file, with equivalents from [`charcoal/contrib-*`][charcoal-org].
3. Run `composer require charcoal/config charcoal/core‚Ä¶` to install the packages.
4. Run `composer update` to ensure all requirements are up-to-date.
5. Replace occurrences of `vendor/locomotivemtl/charcoal-*` in your configuration
   files with `vendor/charcoal/*`.

</details>

### Dependencies

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Required

* [PHP](https://php.net) 7.4 or 8.0

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

[TODO]

## Usage

[TODO]

## Development

Development is made in a seperate branch from the `main` branch. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The `main` branch is protected and doesn't allow pushing changes directly into.

To install the development environment:

```shell
composer install
```

To run the scripts (phplint, phpcs, and phpunit):

```shell
composer test
```

### Commit message format

Charcoal uses [semantic-release] to handle the release process.

It uses the commit messages to determine the consumer impact of changes
in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit messages,
[semantic-release] automatically determines the next [Semantic Version][semver]
number, generates a changelog, and publishes the release.

The current setup uses the [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits] for
commit messages. You can consult it for further information.

This repository is [Commitizen][commitizen] friendly and is configured to use
the [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits] standard, therfore you can
install it globally to ease the process of writting commits.

Alternatively, there is some code editor plugins that can help with the creation
of conventional commits:

* `vscode`
    * [VSCode Conventional Commits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits#:~:text=You%20can%20access%20VSCode%20Conventional,on%20the%20Source%20Control%20menu.)
* `phpstrom`
    * [Conventional Commit](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit)
    * [Git Commit Template](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9861-git-commit-template)

Here is an example of release types based on some commit messages:

* Patch (Fix) release:

    ```yaml
    fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied
    ```

* Minor (Feature) release:

    ```yaml
    feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option
    ```

* Major (Breaking) release:

    ```yaml
    perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option

    BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.
    The default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.
    ```

    > ‚úçüèª Note that the `BREAKING CHANGE: ` token must be in the foot
    > of the commit.

### Development guidelines

Development should be branch-based and commit messages should following
Conventional Commits.

| Steps                                                                                                                                     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Branch from `main` or checkout `develop`                                                                                               | Make sure the `develop` branch is up to date with `main`. You should favor a new branch if the needed work time is not short. On a personal branch, favor using the `rebase` method to keep up to date with the `main` branch               |
| 2. Do your thing                                                                                                                          | Write some code                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3. Commit your changes using the [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits] standard                                                    | You can use [Commitizen][commitizen] or a code editor plugin to help with this process. See the [Commit message format](#commit-message-format) section for more information.                                                               |
| 4. Push to a remote branch and run the `./create-pr` script.                                                                              | Using the `./create-pr` to script to create a PR is not mandatory. You could always create it manually, but the script will be faster, generates a changelog message and assigns a reviewer from the [@charcoalphp/reviewers][gh-reviewers] |
| 5. Wait for a review and a merge to happen                                                                                                | Drink ‚òïÔ∏è and eat üçï                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 6. After the merge is done, github workflows will handle the release process, tagging, updating dependencies and updatting the changelog. | Good Job ! ü§ò                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |


### Maintenance and automations

Symplify's [MonorepoBuilder][symplify/monorepo-builder] is used to handle the
conformity between the core repo and it's packages. It will sync `composer.json`
files and packages versions.

### Scripts

#### __create-pr__

This script streamlines the process of creating a Pull Request. When your branch is ready to be pulled into the `main` or 
another `[target]` branch, this tool will generate it for you, request review form [@charcoalphp/reviewers][gh-reviewers] and add
a beautiful and readable release note generated from the differences between the two breanches. 

Documentation

```shell
Description
  Create a pull request on the github repository on the requested branch.
  Default branch: main

Usage
  ./create-pr

Options
  -b, --base          The base branch to merge into for the pull request. [Default: main]
  -h, --head          The branch to compare against the base branch. [Default: The current branch]
```

Example
```shell
# target: the target branch for the pull request. Defaults to [main]
./create-pr -b main -h user:feat-branch
```

#### __create-release-notes__ (_optional tool_)

This script generates release notes on request, returning a changelog based on the requested `range of commits` or `branches`.

Documentation:

```shell
./build/script/create-release-notes --help
```

Example:

```shell
./build/script/create-release-notes -g --from main
```
