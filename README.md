Charcoal Factory
================

`Charcoal\Factory` defines _factories_, which create or build dynamic Charcoal PHP objects.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/locomotivemtl/charcoal-factory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/locomotivemtl/charcoal-factory)

# How to install

The preferred (and only supported) way of installing _charcoal-factory_ is with **composer**:

```shell
$ composer require locomotivemtl/charcoal-factory
```

## Dependencies

- [`PHP 5.5+`](http://php.net)
	- Older versions of PHP are deprecated, therefore not supported for charcoal-app.

> ðŸ‘‰ Development dependencies, which are optional when using charcoal-app, are described in the [Development](#development) section of this README file.


# Factories

## About factories

Factories have only one purpose: to create / instanciate new PHP objects. There is 2 different methods of object creation:

- Typically, the `create` method instantiates an object, from a class ident.
- Additionnally, the `get` method can be called to retrieve the last created instance.

```php
$factory = new \Charcoal\Factory\IdentFactory();

// Ensure the created object is a Charcoal Model
$factory->setBaseClass('\Charcoal\Model\ModelInterface');

// Create a "news" object (from the `charcoal-cms` module)
$factory->create('charcoal/cms/news');
```

There are 3 default type of factory provided:

### `GenericFactory`

Resolve the **class name** by using the requested **type** directly as the class name.

### `MapFactory`

Resolve the **class name** from an associative array (_map_) with the requested **type** as key.

### `ResolverFactory`

Resolves the **class name** from the `resolve()` method, which typically transform the requested **type** by:

## Ensuring a type of object

Ensuring a type of object can be done by setting the `baseClass`, either forced in a class:

```php
class MyFactory extends AbstractFactory
{
	public function base_class()
	{
		return '\My\Foo\BaseClassInterface`;
	}
}
```

Or, dynamically:

```php
$factory = ResolverFactory::instance();
$factory->setBaseClass('\My\Foo\BaseClassInterface');
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Note that _Interfaces_ can also be used as a factory's base class.

## Setting a default type of object

It is possible to set a default type of object (default class) by setting the `default_class`, either forced in a class:

```php
class MyFactory extends AbstractFactory
{
	public function default_class()
	{
		return '\My\Foo\DefaultClassInterface`;
	}
}
```

Or, dynamically:

```php
$factory = ResolverFactory::instance();
$factory->setDefaultClass('\My\Foo\DefaultClassInterface');
```

> âš  Setting a default class name changes the standard Factory behavior. When an invalid class name is used, instead of throwing an `Exception`, an object of the default class type will **always** be returned.

## The `AbstractFactory` API

| Method                                 | Return value | Description |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `create(string $type [, array $args])` | _Object_     | Create a class from a "type" string. |
| `get(string $type [, array $args])`    | _Object_     | Get returns the latest created class instance, or a new one if none exists. |
| `setBase_class(string $classname)`    | _Chainable_  |             |
| `baseClass()`                         | `string`     |             |
| `setDefaultClass(string $classname)`  | _Chainable_  |             |
| `defaultClass()`                      | `string`     |             |
| `resolve(string $type)`               | `string`     | **abstract**, must be reimplemented in children classes. |
| `isResolvable(string $type)`          | `boolean`    | **abstract**, must be reimplemented in children classes. |

### The `MapFactory` additional API

| Method                                       | Return value | Description |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `addClass(string $type, string $class_name)` | _Chainable_  |             |
| `setMap(array $map)`                         | _Chainable_  |             |
| `map()`                                      | `array`      |             |

### The `GenericFactory` additional API

Because the `ClassNameFactory` uses the parameter directly, there is no additional methods for this type of class.

The `resolve()` method simply returns its _type_ argument, and the `validate()` method simply ensures its _type_ argument is a valid (existing) class.

###The `ResolverFactory` additional API

The `ResolverFactory` resolves the classname from the class resolver options:

- `resolverPrefix` `string` that will be prepended to the resolved class name.
- `resolverSuffix` `string` that will be appended to the resolved class name.
- `resolverCapitals` `array` of characters that will cause the next character to be capitalized.
- `resolverReplacements` `array`

| Method                                           | Return value | Description |
| -----------------------------------------------| ------------ | ----------- |
| `setResolverPrefix(string $prefix)`            | _Chainable_  |             |
| `resolverPrefix()`                             | `string`     |             |
| `setResolverSuffix(string $suffix)`            | _Chainable_  |             |
| `resolverSuffix()`                             | `string`     |             |
| `setResolveCcapitals(array $capitals)`         | _Chainable_  |             |
| `resolverCapitals()`                           | `array`      |             |
| `setResolverReplacements(array $replacements)` | _Chainable_  |             |
| `resolverReplacements()`                       | `array`      |             |

# Usage

To create a `\Foo\Bar\Baz` object:

```php
use \Charcoal\Factory\ResolverFactory;
$obj = ResolverFactory::instance()->create('foo/bar/baz');
```

# Development

To install the development environment:

```shell
$ npm install
$ composer install
```

## Development dependencies

- `npm`
- `grunt` (install with `npm install grunt-cli`)
- `composer`
- `phpunit`

## Coding Style

All Charcoal modules follow the same coding style and `charcoal-factory` is no exception. For PHP:

- [_PSR-1_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)
- [_PSR-2_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
- [_PSR-4_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md), autoloading is therefore provided by _Composer_
- [_phpDocumentor_](http://phpdoc.org/)
	- Add DocBlocks for all classes, methods, and functions;
- Naming conventions
	- Prefix abstract classes with `Abstract`;
	- Suffix interfaces with `Interface`, traits with `Trait`, exceptions with `Exception`;
	- For arrays, use short notation `[]` (instead of `array()`).
	- Read the [phpcs.xml](phpcs.xml) file for all the details.

Coding styles are  enforced with `grunt phpcs` ([_PHP Code Sniffer_](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)). The actual ruleset can be found in `phpcs.xml`.

> ðŸ‘‰ To fix minor coding style problems, run `grunt phpcbf` ([_PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer_](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)). This tool uses the same ruleset as *phpcs* to automatically correct coding standard violations.
